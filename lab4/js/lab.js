//Game State variable
  //0: player count
  //1: betting
  //2: starting hands
  //3: player turns
  //4: Resolve Dealer
//Take player count
  //1-5, max usually 7
//Let player set how much they’re betting
  //Array for player banks
    //W3 Array: https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arrays.asp
      //Can use “text” to make life a lot easier
//Draw 2 cards from a virtual deck for players and dealer
  //Array for player hands
    //Can condense into 1 array if you have a designated “break” value to separate hands in array
  //Array tracking which cards have been drawn
  //Generate number 0-52
  //Check if corresponding spot on deck array is available
    //If false, roll new number
  //When true, add number to player hand array and update deck array
//Assign point values to cards
  //Modulo operator my beloved (x % y in js)
    //(0 through 51) % 13 returns 0 thru 12, assign values to 0 thru 12
  //Aces
    //If hand without ace is <= 10, ace is 11, else 1
    //Any duplicate aces 1
//Print cards in current player’s hand
  //Reveal dealer’s first card
  //1-10, JQK, ♥♦♣♠
//Have players inputs for 
  //First turn
   //Split
    //check if player got 2 cards of the same value
    //If true, give them choice to split
    //If choose, player has 2nd hands made of their starters and draws 1 more card into each
      //Re-split is optional rule, so not gonna do that so I don’t go insane
    //Hand acts like extra player
  //Surrender
    //Remove from the turn order
    //Forfeit half of bet
  //Stand
    //Remove from the turn order
  //Hit
    //Run draw
    //If new hand value > 21, bust
  //Double down
    //Draw & double bet
    //If new hand value > 21, bust
  //Check if the round is over
    //If not, Wait for confirmation the game has been handed off to the next player
      //Player input
      //Move to next player’s turn
    //Players all either bust, surrender or stand
      //Resolve dealer’s hand (dealer continues drawing until 17+ hand value)
        //If dealer highest value, all players lose
        //If dealer busts, all players win
  //Player has blackjack
    //They win, other players lose
  //Dealer has blackjack
    //All players lose
//End game
  //Reset deck tracker
  //Clear hands
  //Update banks
  //Loop back to betting
