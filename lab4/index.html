			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem Solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Create pseudocode for different tasks and games, and implement them into our code. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Switching the pseudocode that was written out into the Javascript comments was tedious. This caused some issue, but not too much problem for the overall task. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>It went well! It was very interesting just to explore the use of pseudocode and to create some for ourselves. I enjoyed putting these into javascript as well as the inplementation into the index.html file. This was interesting to see, as the final product was formed in a list.</p>
			</div>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<pre><code>
						Pseudocode for Washing the Dishes:
						1. Collect the dirty dishes
						2. Put the dishes in the sink
						3. Turn on hot water
						4. Put soap on a sponge
						5. Wash each dish individually
						    a. Rinse the dish in hot water
							b. Scrub the dish with the soapy sponge
							c. Rinse the dish in hot water again
							d. Check for cleanliness
						6. Place dish on drying rack
						7. Turn off water
						8. Ring out sponge
						9. Put away sponge
						10. Dry dishes
							a. Dry using rack
								i. Leave dishes in drying rack until dry
							b. Hand-dry individually
								i. Pick up dish
								ii. Wipe with towel until dry
								iii. Check for water
