					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Work with a partner to experiment with basic javascript data types and variables.</p>
			
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>It was a little tricky to see if everything was correctly added into the code and if it worked. The CSS was also a little challenging to link.</p>
		
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>There is an Html file as well as a Javascript file that are linked! </p>
				
			<h2>Script Output</h2>
